The Engineer will write the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn. The Scientist (if available) can provide insights on which features might be relevant for predicting stock prices and help interpret the results of the machine learning models. Once the code is complete, the Executor will run it to obtain predictions. The Critic will review the code and ensure its accuracy and efficiency before we proceed with using it to make real stock price predictions.\n"
